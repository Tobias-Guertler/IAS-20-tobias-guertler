files ending on code: the code used to run the circuit, includes serial monitor

files ending in full: overview of the full arduino circuit

files ending in side: a side few of the accordion-like VeloStat Setup used, note the placement of the cables

files starting in first: the circuit used to check which design works best, only the final design is featured. Mostly used to determine which state (pressed not pressed) yields which values

files starting in final: the circuit of the final prototype, includes a piezo-buzzer for visualisation
