A good circuit should be foldable on as wide of a variety of creases as possible and connect. Depending on the circuit and the position of the crease, it is possible that the two pieces of copper tape do not connect at all, so we should look for circuits which have a big area in which they can be folded (cmp. small area in figure below). Furthermore the orientation of the crease may also vary, and we want our circuit to be as robust in regards to the orientation of the crease. For example, just two very long strips of copper tape pointed at each other may have a very big area in which they can be succesfully folded, but if they are folded at even a slight angle they do not connect (cmp. bad for angles in figure below).
